LED - 3.3V	    

ESP32 to Relay to SOLENOID

charger 12v:   
        (+) of the charger make two wire 
            1. one for VCC relay
            2. one to Relay COM
        (-) of the charger twist about 4 wires together with the (-) of the charger
            1. first wire connect it to the GND of the Relay
            2. Second wire connect it to the GND of esp32wroom
            3. Third wire connect it to the (-) of SOLENOID
            4. Fourth wire connect it to the left (Emitter {E} - Left) Of the transistor
Relay:
        Relay (IN) connect it to the right part of transistor (Collector {C} - Right)
        Relay (NO) connect to the (+) of solenoid

Esp32 to Breadboard with resistor 1K and to transistor:
        from D12 of ESP32 pins to the breadboard left end of the resistor and right end of resistor to the transistor (Base {B} - Middle)

GPIO13 or D13 = use for button for all time access of relay
